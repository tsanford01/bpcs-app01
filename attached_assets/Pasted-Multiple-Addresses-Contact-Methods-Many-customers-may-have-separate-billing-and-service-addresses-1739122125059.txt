Multiple Addresses & Contact Methods

Many customers may have separate billing and service addresses, or multiple properties. Consider capturing an unlimited number of addresses.
Let customers list multiple phone numbers (work, cell, etc.).
Service History & Schedules

Keep track of each visit or appointment (past and future).
Show what services were performed on each visit (e.g., “Exterior Spray,” “Rodent Inspection,” etc.) and any findings or notes (e.g., “Termite damage found in backyard shed”).
Next scheduled appointment date/time.
Billing & Payment Details

Add an area for invoices, payment history, and outstanding balances.
Integrate or link to your payment processor (if you have one), so you can see if a customer is on autopay or has a saved card on file.
Contracts or Service Plans

Pest control companies often have recurring service plans (monthly, quarterly, yearly). Ensure there’s a field to capture contract start/end dates, plan tier, or add‐on services.
Store and track contract documents or agreements in their profile if needed.
Internal Notes/Tags

Provide a text area for internal notes visible only to staff (e.g., “Watch out for large dog,” “Prefers phone calls to emails,” etc.).
Add tags or labels (e.g., “Commercial Account,” “High‐Priority,” “Termite Warranty”) to quickly categorize customers.
Communication Preferences

Let customers (and staff) specify whether they prefer calls, texts, or emails.
A quick toggle or dropdown for “Preferred Contact Method” avoids unnecessary phone calls or spammy emails.
Customer Status

Instead of just “active,” you might track more nuanced statuses: “Lead,” “Active,” “Suspended,” “Pending Payment,” “Former Customer,” etc.
This is helpful for marketing and reactivation campaigns.
Automated Notifications and Reminders

Use the system to remind customers of upcoming appointments, overdue payments, or recommended service intervals.
Provide a field to store the last time a reminder was sent.
Attach Documents or Photos

Allow staff to attach images (e.g., a photo of the pest infestation, contract docs, receipts).
Provide a quick “Documents” or “Photos” tab so that all relevant materials are stored in one place.
