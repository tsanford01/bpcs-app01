# **Putting It All Together**

Each subpage follows a consistent structure: **Header, Navigation, Main Content**, with **cards** or **lists** for essential data, and a **detail pane** or **modal** for deeper info or actions. On **Mobile**, everything collapses into vertical lists or minimal navigational elements to maximize screen space.

**Remember**: These layouts are **high-level**. In actual design, you’ll refine spacing, color schemes, typography, and interactive elements to create a polished user experience.
